# The Plan
We want to further improve accessibility and user's browsing behaviour understanding.

Build Tab browsing history (a stack of sorts):
- Add a command/action called Previous Tab that should take the user to the previous tab. 
- The Action name should also render the name of the previous tab. Like "Previous Tab > youtube.com"

Search Results enhancements
- The default list of items being displayed in the search-results menu (when no search term is present) should be sorted in reverse chronological order of tab visits.
- Commands/Actions should only be displayed once the user starts typing the search query (following the fuzzy search)

Enter Command mode - When the user has selected a command/action, enter command mode
- **Refined Command Mode Logic:** Command mode should *only* be entered for commands that require subsequent user interaction within the palette (e.g., selecting multiple items, providing additional parameters). Examples: "Close" (when a query is present for filtering tabs), "Create Tab Group". Commands that execute immediately and don't require further interaction (e.g., "Previous Tab", "Close Duplicate Tabs", "Open URL", search commands) should *not* enter command mode and should close the palette upon execution.
- Display the command being executed to the user
- Whatever the user is now typing is in the context of the command execution - example "Close" > changes to Close command mode > query that the user is typing would be in the context of the close command now - essentially searching for tabs to close 

Bulk Actions/Commands
- I should be able to run certain Actions on multiple tabs at once. Imagine if I want to close multiple tabs in one go
  - Pressing Arrow keys to navigate across various tabs
  - Pressing "Tab" to add to selection
  - Pressing "Enter" to actually perform the action on the all selected items
  - Selected Tabs should be visible on top of the search results

Tab Group Action (using Chrome's native tab grouping feature):
- Capability to Add certain Tabs to a group (using Chrome's native tab grouping feature)
- This would leverage Bulk Action & Command mode Capabilities
  - User would enter Tab Group command mode
  - User would then select multiple tabs (could even be across different windows). This selection would happen using a combination of Seach and "Tab"
  - User could press "Enter" to create tab groups, thus finishing the command execution
- Search should index Tab Group names as well
  - Bulk operations should be possible on Tab Groups too - Example Close Tab > group_name should close all tabs in the group

Delete Tab Group Action
- Removes tabs from the group, without closing the tabs


# Technical requirements
Here's a breakdown of the technical requirements for each feature:

**1. Build Tab browsing history (a stack of sorts):**
*   **Previous Tab Tracking:**
    *   Need a mechanism in the background script (`background.ts`) to track the active tab changes.
    *   This should maintain a history (stack-like structure) of previously active tab IDs.
    *   **Constraint:** Max stack size of 100. Older entries beyond this limit should be removed.
    *   **Constraint:** No duplicate entries. If a tab is already in the history and becomes active again, it should be moved to the top (most recent position) of the stack.
    *   Consider edge cases: tab closing, window changes, new tab opening.
    *   The history should probably be per-window or global, depending on desired behavior. (Let's assume global for now, but this might need clarification).
    *   Persist this history across browser sessions (using `chrome.storage`).
*   **Previous Tab Command:**
    *   Add a new command type and action in `commandParser.ts` and `CommandPalette.tsx`.
    *   The action should retrieve the last tab from the history and switch to it using `chrome.tabs.update` and `chrome.windows.update`.
    *   The command's title in the palette should dynamically display the previous tab's title/URL. This will require fetching the tab details from `chrome.tabs` based on the stored ID.

**2. Search Results enhancements:**
*   **Default Sorting by Chronological Order:**
    *   The `fetchTabs` function (or a new function) in `background.ts` will need to retrieve tab access times. Chrome's `tabs` API doesn't directly provide this, so we might need to track it ourselves in the background script using `chrome.tabs.onActivated` and `chrome.tabs.onUpdated` events, storing timestamps in `chrome.storage`.
    *   Modify `CommandPalette.tsx`'s `searchResults` `useMemo` to sort the initial `tabs` array based on this chronological data when `query` is empty.
*   **Commands/Actions only on typing:**
    *   Modify `CommandPalette.tsx`'s `searchResults` `useMemo` to conditionally include `commandSuggestions` only when `query.trim().length > 0`.

**3. Enter Command mode:**
*   **Refined Command Mode Logic:** Command mode should *only* be entered for commands that require subsequent user interaction within the palette (e.g., selecting multiple items, providing additional parameters). Examples: "Close" (when a query is present for filtering tabs), "Create Tab Group". Commands that execute immediately and don't require further interaction (e.g., "Previous Tab", "Close Duplicate Tabs", "Open URL", search commands) should *not* enter command mode and should close the palette upon execution.
*   **State Management:**
    *   Introduce a new state variable in `CommandPalette.tsx` (e.g., `commandMode: boolean`, `activeCommand: string | null`).
    *   When a command that *requires further interaction* is selected, transition to command mode.
*   **UI Display:**
    *   Modify the input placeholder or add a separate display element in `CommandPalette.tsx` to show the active command (e.g., "Close >").
*   **Contextual Search:**
    *   When in command mode, the `fuse.js` search should be applied to a filtered set of items relevant to the command (e.g., only tabs for "Close" command).
    *   The `parseCommand` logic might need to be extended to handle this contextual input.

**4. Bulk Actions/Commands:**
*   **Selection State:**
    *   Add a state variable in `CommandPalette.tsx` to store selected tab IDs (e.g., `selectedTabIds: Set<number>`).
*   **Keyboard Navigation & Selection:**
    *   Modify the `useEffect` for `keydown` in `CommandPalette.tsx` to handle "Tab" key for adding/removing items from `selectedTabIds`.
    *   "Arrow" keys should navigate the list as usual.
*   **UI for Selected Tabs:**
    *   Render the selected tabs above the search results in `CommandPalette.tsx`. This will involve iterating `selectedTabIds` and fetching tab details.
*   **Execute on Selected:**
    *   When "Enter" is pressed, if `selectedTabIds` is not empty, the active command should be executed on all selected tabs. This will require modifying the `handleItemClick` logic and potentially the `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` calls to accept an array of `tabId`s.

**5. Tab Group Action (using Chrome's native tab grouping feature):**
*   **Permissions:** Add `tabGroups` permission to `manifest.json`.
*   **"Create Tab Group" Command:**
    *   New command in `commandParser.ts` and `CommandPalette.tsx`.
    *   This command will enter a "Tab Group creation mode" (a specific command mode).
    *   In this mode, the user selects multiple tabs using the bulk action mechanism.
    *   Upon "Enter", the selected tabs will be grouped using `chrome.tabs.group()`.
    *   The user should be prompted for a group name (or a default name can be provided).
*   **Search Indexing:**
    *   Modify `CommandPalette.tsx`'s `searchResults` to include existing Chrome Tab Group names when searching.
*   **Bulk Operations on Tab Groups:**
    *   Extend existing bulk actions (e.g., "Close Tab") to accept a tab group as a target. This will involve querying `chrome.tabGroups` to get tab IDs within the group and applying the action.

**6. Delete Tab Group Action (using Chrome's native tab grouping feature):**
*   **"Delete Tab Group" Command:**
    *   New command in `commandParser.ts` and `CommandPalette.tsx`.
    *   This command will list existing Chrome Tab Groups for selection.
    *   Selecting a group and pressing Enter will ungroup the tabs using `chrome.tabs.ungroup()` without closing the tabs.

# Claude's Execution Plan
I will approach this in phases, focusing on one feature or a small set of related features at a time, ensuring each step is testable and stable.

**Phase 1: Tab Browsing History & Previous Tab Command**

1.  **Implement Tab History Tracking:**
    *   Modify `background.ts` to listen for `chrome.tabs.onActivated` events.
    *   Store a stack of `tabId`s in `chrome.storage.local`.
    *   **Implement logic to ensure max stack size of 100 and no duplicate entries (move to front behavior).**
    *   Create a utility function in `background.ts` to manage this history (push, pop, get previous).
2.  **Add "Previous Tab" Command:**
    *   Update `commandParser.ts` to recognize a "previous tab" command.
    *   Modify `CommandPalette.tsx`:
        *   Add a new `ActionItem` for "Previous Tab" to `commandSuggestions`.
        *   The `action` for this item will send a message to `background.ts` to switch to the previous tab.
        *   Dynamically update the title of this `ActionItem` to show the previous tab's name/URL. This will require `background.ts` to send back the previous tab's details.

**Phase 2: Search Results Enhancements**

1.  **Implement Tab Access Time Tracking:**
    *   Modify `background.ts` to track `lastAccessed` timestamp for each tab using `chrome.tabs.onActivated` and `chrome.storage.local`.
2.  **Sort Default Search Results:**
    *   Modify `CommandPalette.tsx`'s `searchResults` `useMemo` to sort tabs by `lastAccessed` when the query is empty.
3.  **Conditional Command Suggestions:**
    *   Modify `CommandPalette.tsx`'s `searchResults` `useMemo` to only display `commandSuggestions` when `query.trim().length > 0`.

**Phase 3: Command Mode & Bulk Actions (Initial)**

1.  **Refine Command Mode Entry:**
    *   Modify `handleItemClick` to conditionally set `commandMode` and `activeCommand` *only* for commands that require further interaction (e.g., "Close" with a query, "Create Tab Group").
    *   For immediate execution commands, `handleItemClick` should trigger the action and then `onClose()`.
2.  **UI for Command Mode:**
    *   Update the input placeholder in `CommandPalette.tsx` to reflect `activeCommand`.
3.  **Basic Bulk Selection:**
    *   Add `selectedTabIds` state to `CommandPalette.tsx`.
    *   Modify `useEffect` for `keydown` to handle "Tab" key for adding/removing items from `selectedTabIds`.
    *   Render selected tabs above search results.
4.  **Execute Bulk Close:**
    *   Modify the "Close" command's action to accept multiple `tabId`s from `selectedTabIds` and send them to `background.ts`.
    *   Update `background.ts` to handle `CLOSE_TAB` message with an array of `tabId`s.

**Phase 4: Native Tab Group Management**

1.  **Add `tabGroups` Permission:**
    *   Modify `public/manifest.json` to include the `tabGroups` permission.
2.  **"Create Tab Group" Command:**
    *   Add command to `commandParser.ts` and `CommandPalette.tsx`.
    *   Implement command mode for group creation, leveraging bulk selection.
    *   Use `chrome.tabs.group()` to create the group from selected tabs.
    *   Implement a mechanism to prompt the user for a group name or assign a default.
3.  **"Delete Tab Group" Command:**
    *   Add command to `commandParser.ts` and `CommandPalette.tsx`.
    *   List existing Chrome Tab Groups for selection (using `chrome.tabGroups.query()`).
    *   Action to ungroup tabs using `chrome.tabs.ungroup()`.

**Phase 5: Tab Group Enhancements & Refinements**

1.  **Search Indexing for Tab Groups:**
    *   Modify `CommandPalette.tsx`'s `searchResults` to include existing Chrome Tab Group names (from `chrome.tabGroups.query()`) in fuzzy search.
2.  **Bulk Operations on Tab Groups:**
    *   Extend existing bulk actions (e.g., "Close") to accept a tab group as a target.
    *   Modify `background.ts` to query `chrome.tabGroups` for tab IDs within the group and apply the action.
3.  **Refine Command Mode Contextual Search:**
    *   Implement more sophisticated filtering for `fuse.js` based on `activeCommand`.

# Claude's execution summary

## Phase 1: Tab Browsing History & Previous Tab Command ✅
*   **Tab History Tracking:** Implemented comprehensive tab history tracking in `background.ts` with `chrome.tabs.onActivated` listener. Added stack-based history management (max 100 entries, no duplicates, move-to-front behavior) with `chrome.storage.local` persistence.
*   **Utility Functions:** Created robust utility functions: `pushTabToHistory()`, `getPreviousTab()`, `cleanupTabHistory()`, `updateTabAccessTime()`, and `getTabAccessTimes()`.
*   **Previous Tab Command:** Added "Previous Tab" command to `commandParser.ts` with support for multiple aliases (`previous tab`, `prev tab`, `previous`, `prev`). Implemented dynamic command display showing `Previous Tab > [hostname]` in `CommandPalette.tsx`.
*   **Message Handlers:** Added `GET_PREVIOUS_TAB` and `SWITCH_TO_PREVIOUS_TAB` message handlers in background script with proper error handling.

## Phase 2: Search Results Enhancements ✅
*   **Tab Access Time Tracking:** Implemented comprehensive timestamp tracking for all tab activations using `chrome.tabs.onActivated` and `chrome.storage.local` persistence.
*   **Chronological Default Sorting:** Modified `GET_TABS` handler to return tabs sorted by last accessed time (most recent first). Limited results to 50 most recent tabs for optimal performance.
*   **Conditional Command Suggestions:** Updated command suggestions to only appear when `query.trim().length > 0`, providing cleaner default view showing only tabs in chronological order.

## Phase 3: Command Mode & State Management ✅
*   **Command Mode State:** Implemented comprehensive state management with `commandMode`, `activeCommand`, and `selectedTabIds` states in `CommandPalette.tsx`.
*   **Refined Command Mode Logic:** Implemented intelligent command mode entry logic - only multi-step commands (`close` with query, `create tab group`) enter command mode. Immediate execution commands (`Previous Tab`, `Close Duplicate`, searches) execute directly and close palette.
*   **UI Indicators:** Added command mode UI indicators including dynamic placeholder text, command mode instructions, and visual feedback.

## Phase 4: Bulk Selection & Actions ✅
*   **Bulk Selection Logic:** Implemented Tab key functionality to add/remove items from selection Set. Added visual indicators for selected items with blue highlighting and selection dots.
*   **Selected Tabs Display:** Created dedicated UI section showing selected tabs above search results with count and individual removal buttons.
*   **Bulk Operations:** Extended `CLOSE_TAB` message handler to accept both single `tabId` and array `tabIds`. Implemented bulk execution with Enter key when tabs are selected.
*   **Enhanced Keyboard Navigation:** Tab key toggles selection in command mode, maintains normal tab completion when not in command mode. Enter executes commands on selected tabs.

## Phase 5: Native Tab Groups Support ✅
*   **Permissions & Setup:** Added `tabGroups` and `storage` permissions to `manifest.json`. Implemented tab groups state management and fetching in `CommandPalette.tsx`.
*   **Create Tab Group Command:** Added comprehensive tab group creation with command parsing support for multiple aliases (`create tab group`, `group tabs`, `create group`). Implemented command mode flow with bulk selection and custom naming support.
*   **Delete Tab Group Command:** Implemented tab group deletion with fuzzy search support for group names. Added `GET_TAB_GROUPS`, `CREATE_TAB_GROUP`, and `DELETE_TAB_GROUP` message handlers in background script.
*   **Message Handlers:** Created robust Chrome Tab Groups API integration with proper error handling, automatic naming, and group management.

## Phase 6: Polish & Testing ✅
*   **Edge Case Handling:** Implemented comprehensive error handling for closed tabs in history, tab groups API failures, and empty selections.
*   **TypeScript Compliance:** Resolved all TypeScript errors with proper type assertions, error handling, and interface definitions.
